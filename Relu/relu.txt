ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a simple activation function used in deep learning. 
It converts all negative numbers to zero and keeps positive numbers unchanged.
This helps the model learn faster by preventing the vanishing gradient problem, allowing gradients to pass through more effectively. 
ReLU is widely used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to its efficiency and ability to improve learning performance.
