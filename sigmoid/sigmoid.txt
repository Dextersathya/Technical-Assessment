The Sigmoid activation function takes any input and outputs a value between 0 and 1.
 This makes it especially useful for tasks like binary classification, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes. 
 The output can be interpreted as the probability that something belongs to a particular class,
  making it ideal for models like logistic regression that deal with probabilities.
